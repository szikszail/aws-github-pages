# aws-github-pages

This project sets custom domains for GitHub Pages of my public NPM repositories with documentations, including
1. creating the sub-domain in AWS Route53
2. setting the sub-domain in GitHub Pages
3. setting up certificate (HTTPS) for the sub-domain in GitHub Pages *(GitHub does this automatically, but we first need to wait for it to be created)*
4. setting the sub-domain as home page for the repository.
